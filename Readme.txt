My_Threads - The purpose of this file is to run the whole program. This will run all 103 threads
3 for the tellers and 100 for the clients


How to compile and run
I was running in an IDE but you should be to run it with 
java My_Threads

Other notes
My program is not random on the number for the client created or which client gets worked with.
The program goes through the 0-99 clients in a loop
